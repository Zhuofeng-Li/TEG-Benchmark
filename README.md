## Why TEGs instead of TAGs? 🤔

Textual-Edge Graphs (TEGs) incorporate textual content on **both nodes and edges**, unlike Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs) featuring textual information **only at the nodes**. **Edge texts are crucial for understanding document meanings and semantic relationships.** For instance, as shown below, to understand the knowledge "Planck endorsed the uncertainty and probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics," **citation edge (Book D - Paper E) text information is essential**. This reveals the comprehensive connections and influences among scholarly works, enabling a deeper analysis of document semantics and knowledge networks.

## Overview 📚

Textual-Edge Graphs Datasets and Benchmark (TEG-DB) is a comprehensive and diverse collection of benchmark textual-edge datasets featuring rich textual descriptions on nodes and edges, data loaders, and performance benchmarks for various baseline models,  including pre-trained language models (PLMs), graph neural networks (GNNs), and their combinations. This repository aims to facilitate research in the domain of textual-edge graphs by providing standardized data formats and easy-to-use tools for model evaluation and comparison.

## Features ✨

+ **Unified Data Representation:** All TEG datasets are represented in a unified format. This standardization allows for easy extension of new datasets into our benchmark.
+ **Highly Efficient Pipeline:** TEG-Benchmark is highly integrated with PyTorch Geometric (PyG), leveraging its powerful tools and functionalities. Therefore, its code is concise. Specifically, for each paradigm, we provide a small `.py` file with a summary of all relevant models and a `.ssh` file  to run all baselines in one click.
+ **Comprehensive Benchmark and Analysis:** We conduct extensive benchmark experiments and perform a comprehensive analysis of TEG-based methods, delving deep into various aspects such as the impact of different models, the effect of embeddings generated by Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) of various scales, and the influence of different domain datasets. The statistics of our TEG datasets are as follows:
