In the process, they open up a conversation about parenting, granting us permission to admit our frustrations, and laugh at their absurdity.With illustrations by Ricardo Cortes, Go the Fuck to Sleepis beautiful, subversive, and pants-wettingly funnya book for parents new, old, and expectant. You probably should not read it to your children."

Even more remarkably, her classmates love her even though she's a super-nerd and the teacher's pet. But everything is not perfect in Matilda's world. For starters she has two of the most idiotic, self-centered parents who ever lived. Then there's the large, busty nightmare of a school principal, Mrs. (\"The\") Trunchbull, a former hammer-throwing champion who flings children at will and is approximately as sympathetic as a bulldozer. Fortunately for Matilda, she has the inner resources to deal with such annoyances: astonishing intelligence, saintly patience, and an innate predilection for revenge.\nShe warms up with some practical jokes aimed at her hapless parents, but the true test comes when she rallies in defense of her teacher, the sweet Miss Honey, against the diabolical Trunchbull. There is never any doubt that Matilda will carry the day. Even so, this wonderful story is far from predictable. Roald Dahl, while keeping the plot moving imaginatively, also has an unerring ear for emotional truth. The reader cares about Matilda because in addition to all her other gifts, she has real feelings."

There's nothing wrong with the audiobook--it's read by a cast of narrators that would top the all star list of any hipster parent (I'm identifying you as a hipster parent if you can immediately recognize the voices of Ira Glass, Sarah Vowell, Rachel Maddow, and Terry Gross). And it's really fun to listen to Vowell, Gross, and the rest, but it would have been nicer to also see the adorable drawings by Seth (just Seth) interspersed throughout the stories. \n Another drawback to having only the audiobook is that the conclusion to each of the mysterious incidents are separated from the ends of each story (\"for security reasons\"), and I would have loved to immediately flip to the end of the book after each story; but I had to wait. And by the time I got to the conclusions, I didn't have each story fresh in my mind. \n Now, the terrific word play, Snicket snarkiness, and modern day boy detective genre are a joy to read. But I would recommend that you get the audiobook and the hard copy so that if you're reading it with a child, you and your little one can read along and look at the pictures as the terrific cast of narrators reads the stories. This would be especially beneficial since there are so many vocabulary nuggets that are explained in contextual asides--for young readers it would be great to see the words typed out and hear them out loud. And if you're reading it alone, just as an adult who loves Snicket stories, then you would have the fun of the illustrations and listening to Terry Gross read a story about a kidnapped newt.

I love a good \"coming of age\" story and this ticks every box: a likeable and intelligent protagonist, an important discovery about the world that forces the protagonist to make a discovery about himself, and a significant change. \n What Lowry does so perfectly is create a community that is believably \"perfect,\" so while Jonas is living an ideal childhood, riding bikes, playing catch, learning, volunteering, spending time sharing with his family, and being shielded from any decisions, I can appreciate the specific kind of happiness that comes with all of it. To be free from starvation, poverty, war, or, actually, true humanity, would be a type of wonderful vacation. But vacations get old after a while, and Lowry knows just when to make Jonas and the reader want to leave for something that is more painful but more real, more human. \n The audiobook's narrator, Ron Rifkin, does an excellent job and that's my only disappointment: I have the other two books in The Giver's loose trilogy, but neither of those books, Gathering Blue and Messenger, are narrated by Rifkin.

But not for our 13-year-old hero, who's forced to spend his summers with an aunt, uncle, and cousin who detest him. The third book in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series catapults into action when the young wizard \"accidentally\" causes the Dursleys' dreadful visitor Aunt Marge to inflate like a monstrous balloon and drift up to the ceiling. Fearing punishment from Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon (and from officials at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry who strictly forbid students to cast spells in the nonmagic world of Muggles), Harry lunges out into the darkness with his heavy trunk and his owl Hedwig. As it turns out, Harry isn't punished at all for his errant wizardry. Instead he is mysteriously rescued from his Muggle neighborhood and whisked off in a triple-decker, violently purple bus to spend the remaining weeks of summer in a friendly inn called the Leaky Cauldron. What Harry has to face as he begins his third year at Hogwarts explains why the officials let him off easily. It seems that Sirius Black--an escaped convict from the prison of Azkaban--is on the loose. Not only that, but he's after Harry Potter. But why? And why do the Dementors, the guards hired to protect him, chill Harry's very heart when others are unaffected? Once again, Rowling has created a mystery that will have children and adults cheering, not to mention standing in line for her next book. Fortunately, there are four more in the works.

The two enjoy a series of adventures, accidentally witnessing a murder, establishing the innocence of the man wrongly accused, as well as being hunted by Injun Joe, the true murderer, eventually escaping and finding the treasure that Joe had buried.\nHuckleberry Finn recounts the further adventures of Huck, who runs away from a drunken and brutal father, and meets up with the escaped slave Jim. They float down the Mississippi on a raft, participating in the lives of the characters they meet, witnessing corruption, moral decay and intellectual impoverishment."

And she would go in comfort-she would live at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. She saved her money, and she invited her brother Jamie to go, mostly because be was a miser and would have money. Claudia was a good organizer and Jamie bad some ideas, too; so the two took up residence at the museum right on schedule. But once the fun of settling in was over, Claudia had two unexpected problems: She felt just the same, and she wanted to feel different; and she found a statue at the Museum so beautiful she could not go home until she bad discovered its maker, a question that baffled the experts, too. \nThe former owner of the statue was Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler. Without her-well, without her, Claudia might never have found a way to go home."

        "description": "Matilda is a little girl who is far too good to be true. At age five-and-a-half she's knocking off double-digit multiplication problems and blitz-reading Dickens. Even more remarkably, her classmates love her even though she's a super-nerd and the teacher's pet. But everything is not perfect in Matilda's world. For starters she has two of the most idiotic, self-centered parents who ever lived. Then there's the large, busty nightmare of a school principal, Mrs. (\"The\") Trunchbull, a former hammer-throwing champion who flings children at will and is approximately as sympathetic as a bulldozer. Fortunately for Matilda, she has the inner resources to deal with such annoyances: astonishing intelligence, saintly patience, and an innate predilection for revenge.\nShe warms up with some practical jokes aimed at her hapless parents, but the true test comes when she rallies in defense of her teacher, the sweet Miss Honey, against the diabolical Trunchbull. There is never any doubt that Matilda will carry the day. Even so, this wonderful story is far from predictable. Roald Dahl, while keeping the plot moving imaginatively, also has an unerring ear for emotional truth. The reader cares about Matilda because in addition to all her other gifts, she has real feelings."

Profane, affectionate, and radically honest, California Book Award-winning author Adam Mansbach's verses perfectly capture the familiar -- and unspoken -- tribulations of putting your little angel down for the night. In the process, he opens up a conversation about parenting, granting us permission to admit our frustrations and laugh at their absurdities.With illustrations by Ricardo Cortes, Go the Fuck to Sleepis beautiful, subversive and pants-wettingly funny, a book for parents new, old and expectant. You probably should not read it to your children."
